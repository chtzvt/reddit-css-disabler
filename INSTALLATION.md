**From this source:

If you'd prefer to manually install this package on your machine, without going through the Chrome web store, 
then these instructions are for you. 

!NOTE: Installing in this way means that the extension won't update automatically. 
(Not that there's much for me *to* update, but still)

Also note that this process WILL NOT WORK on Chrome stable for Windows.
To install on Windows, you must be using the dev or canary builds of Chrome.

Normal users: It is highly recommended that you install from the web store. 

1: Download the .zip file for this repository (Click the white "Download ZIP" button)

2: Once the file is downloaded, unpack the zip and put the secureddit folder somewhere.

3: Go to chrome://extensions and select "Load unpacked extension...".
3a: Ifs you don't see this button, click the "Developer mode" tickbox. The previously mentioned button will then appear.  

4: In the dialog that appears, browse to the extracted secureddit folder and click  the "Open" button.

Chrome will now load the extension. 

5: Close Chrome completely, then open it again.

SecuReddit is now installed! Yay!
